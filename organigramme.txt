Here's the organigramme for the provided code:

1.Start
2.Import the necessary libraries: cv2, cvzone, and FaceMeshDetector
3.Define the main function
4.Create a VideoCapture object to capture video from the default camera (index 0)
5.Create a FaceMeshDetector object with a maximum of 1 face
6.Define the width (W) of the object in centimeters
7.Define the focal length (f)
8.Enter the main loop
9.Read a frame from the video capture
10.Use the FaceMeshDetector to find face meshes in the frame
11.If faces are detected
   - Get the first face from the list of faces
   - Extract the left and right points from the face mesh
   - Draw a line connecting the left and right points on the frame
   - Draw filled circles at the left and right points
   - Calculate the width (w) between the left and right points
   - Calculate the distance (d) using the formula: d = (W * f) / w
   - Display the depth text on the frame
12.Show the frame with the drawn annotations
13.Check if the 'q' key is pressed to exit the loop
14.Release the video capture object
15.Close all windows
16.End


Note:
   -The code assumes that you have the necessary dependencies
    installed, including the cvzone library and the FaceMeshModule.
