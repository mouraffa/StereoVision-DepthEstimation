# StereoVision-DepthEstimation

The StereoVision-DepthEstimation project is a research-based implementation of stereo vision and camera calibration techniques for depth estimation. It utilizes computer vision algorithms to calculate the depth of an object in real-time using a webcam.

## Features

- Real-time depth estimation using stereo vision principles
- Facial feature detection and tracking using FaceMeshModule
- Display of calculated depth on the video stream

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/StereoVision-DepthEstimation.git


2. Install the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. Run the main script:
2. A video stream will open showing the webcam feed.
3. Ensure that your face is properly visible within the frame.
4. The depth estimation will be displayed on the video stream.
